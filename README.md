# gRPC Demo

A working demo that replaces a dual-channel **stdio-flags + WebSocket** communication architecture with a single, typed **gRPC** channel between a Flutter app, a Flutter package, and a Python server.

---

## Why gRPC?

| Old pattern | gRPC replacement |
|---|---|
| Write flag string to `stdin`, poll `stdout` for ack | Unary RPC — typed request in, typed response out |
| Open WebSocket, send/receive raw frames, close | Server-streaming RPC — typed chunks until stream ends |
| Two channels to manage | Single `ClientChannel` |
| String-based contracts, easy to break | `.proto` schema — enforced on both sides |
| Manual error handling | gRPC status codes built-in |

---

## Architecture

```
Flutter App  (flutter_demo/app/)
  └─ grpc_client package  (flutter_demo/packages/grpc_client/)
       ├─ demo_client.dart          ← your wrapper: connect/disconnect/call
       └─ generated/                ← protoc output (gitignored, created by setup.sh)
            ├─ demo.pb.dart
            └─ demo.pbgrpc.dart
                    ↕  HTTP/2  (gRPC)
            Python gRPC Server  (python_server/)
                 └─ server.py
```

### Communication patterns

| Button in app | Pattern | gRPC call |
|---|---|---|
| **Ping** | Health check | Unary `Ping` |
| **Execute Command** | Send command → get result | Unary `ExecuteCommand` |
| **Trigger Error** | Error path demo | Unary `ExecuteCommand(error)` |
| **Stream Output** | Receive data chunks | Server-streaming `StreamOutput` |

The app launches the Python server automatically on connect and kills it on disconnect — no manual terminal steps for the end user.

## Prerequisites

### macOS
```bash
brew install python protobuf
# Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos
```

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip protobuf-compiler \
     libgtk-3-dev libblkid-dev liblzma-dev ninja-build cmake pkg-config
# Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux
```

> `protoc` is only needed to regenerate client code when `demo.proto` changes.

---

## Setup

> **Note:** Generated files are gitignored. `setup.sh` creates everything from scratch. Run it once after cloning.

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skbansal5642/grpc_demo_flutter_python
cd grpc_demo
```

### 2. Make Flutter available in PATH

`setup.sh` looks for `flutter` in your `PATH`. Either add it permanently to your shell profile, or pass the location via the `FLUTTER_HOME` variable:

```bash
# Option A — Flutter already in PATH (recommended)
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"

# Option B — pass it once to setup.sh
FLUTTER_HOME=/path/to/flutter ./setup.sh
```

### 3. Run setup

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` does the following in order:

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| Creates `python_server/venv/` | Isolated Python environment (avoids system pip restrictions) |
| Installs Python deps into venv | `grpcio`, `grpcio-tools`, `websockets` |
| Generates `python_server/generated/` | `demo_pb2.py`, `demo_pb2_grpc.py` from `demo.proto` |
| Activates `protoc-gen-dart` plugin | Via `dart pub global activate protoc_plugin` |
| Generates `grpc_client/lib/src/generated/` | `demo.pb.dart`, `demo.pbgrpc.dart` from `demo.proto` |
| Generates `nfr_benchmark/lib/src/generated/` | Same proto compiled for the benchmark package |
| Scaffolds `flutter_demo/app/` | Runs `flutter create` with the correct platform(s) if the app doesn't exist |
| Installs Flutter deps | `flutter pub get` in both packages and the app |
| *(macOS only)* Adds network entitlement | Required for outbound gRPC (HTTP/2) on macOS sandbox |

### 4. Run the app

**macOS:**
```bash
cd flutter_demo/app
flutter run -d macos
```

**Linux:**
```bash
cd flutter_demo/app
flutter run -d linux
```

Press **Start & Connect** in the **gRPC Demo** tab — it automatically starts the Python gRPC server and connects to it.

To run the **NFR Benchmark**, switch to the **NFR Benchmark** tab, set the server path to the absolute path of `python_server/`, and press **Run Benchmark**.

## Distributing a .deb Package (Linux)

To share the app as an installable `.deb` for other Linux machines:

### On the build machine (one time)
```bash
# 1. Complete setup first (generates all proto + Flutter deps)
./setup.sh

# 2. Build the .deb
chmod +x build_deb.sh
./build_deb.sh
# → creates dist/grpc-demo-app_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

### On the target machine
```bash
# Install
sudo dpkg -i grpc-demo-app_1.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f    # resolves any missing system libs

# Run
grpc-demo-app              # from terminal
# or launch from the application menu
```

The `.deb` bundles everything:
- Flutter Linux binary + all shared libraries
- Python demo server (`server.py`) and benchmark servers
- Pre-generated Python proto files

The `postinst` script automatically creates a Python venv and installs `grpcio` / `websockets` on the target — no manual Python setup needed.

To uninstall:
```bash
sudo apt remove grpc-demo-app          # remove binaries, keep venv
sudo apt purge grpc-demo-app           # remove everything including venv
```

## Regenerating Proto Files

When `demo.proto` changes, regenerate both sides and commit the results:

**Python:**
```bash
cd python_server
source venv/bin/activate
python -m grpc_tools.protoc \
  -I../proto \
  --python_out=generated \
  --grpc_python_out=generated \
  ../proto/demo.proto
```

**Dart:**
```bash
cd flutter_demo/packages/grpc_client
protoc \
  --dart_out=grpc:lib/src/generated \
  -I../../proto \
  ../../proto/demo.proto
```

Then update `demo_client.dart` if any method signatures changed.

---

## Team Ownership

| Artifact | Owner |
|---|---|
| `proto/demo.proto` | Shared — changes require agreement from both teams |
| `python_server/` | Python team |
| `packages/grpc_client/lib/src/generated/` | Generated — re-run protoc when proto changes |
| `packages/grpc_client/lib/src/demo_client.dart` | Flutter team |
| `flutter_demo/app/` | Flutter team |

> **Recommended:** As the project matures, move `demo.proto` to a dedicated shared repo and reference it as a git submodule in both repos. CI/CD can then auto-publish a new `grpc_client` package version whenever the proto changes.
